# Weather-Journal App Project Jordan Stewart

## Overview
This project has been developed to demonstrate my understanding of connecting to an API (in this case the Openwaether API) and retrieving information of this API to assist in building a dynamic web application hosted on a local-server.

## Instructions
To run the project, you need to open a command prompt (ensuring you have node installed) and then run the command node server.js on the entire project folder. If the default port number is already being used on your machine, you can modify the 'server.js' file to an available port number.

Once connected, open the localhost port - e.g: locahlost:8000 domain, and then you can begin to use the web-application.

For the web-application use, simply enter in your post-code followed by a feeling of your choice and the outcome should present the current date your, your post-code, the current temperature of your entered post-code and the feeling you entered.
